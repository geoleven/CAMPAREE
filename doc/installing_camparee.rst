Installing CAMPAREE
===================

.. _installing-general:

General Instructions
--------------------

The following installation instructions are for Python3 installed in a Linux
environment. Windows/Mac environments, or environments using an Anaconda/Miniconda
installation of Python may require slight modifications to the commands below.

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- python version 3.11
- Java 1.8

1. Create a Python virtual environment to install required Python libraries to:

    python3 -m venv ./venv_camparee

2. Activate the environment:

    source ./venv_camparee/bin/activate

3. Install CAMPAREE:

    pip install git+https://github.com/itmat/CAMPAREE

4. [Optional] Validate installation using the 'Baby Genome' as described in the :ref:`quick start guide <quick-start-baby-genome>`.

5. Prepare/install resource files for the organism of choice (see full instructions in :ref:`Resource Files <resource-pre-built>` section).

Installing CAMPAREE on AWS
--------------------------

While CAMPAREE can run on a single machine, it can require 50-60 GB of RAM to
simulated samples from a mammalian-size genome, and a cluster computing environment
can substantially decrease run times. For users who do not have access to machines
with enough memory or a supported cluster environment, Amazon Web Services (AWS)
provide a viable alternative for running CAMPAREE. These instructions assume users
have access to an AWS account with associated IAM key pairs, and have a passing
familiarity with checking out AWS instances through the web interface (the AWS
Management Console).

Note: AWS is an excellent resource for providing pay-as-you-go access to high-end
machines. However, as a cloud-based service, it is important users take approrpiate
security measure to secure their AWS instances. A full discussion of the many
security feature available through AWS, such as restricting access to a range of
IP addresses, is the beyond the scope of this document. These instructions are
meant as a starting point, and are written to be as broadly applicable as possible.
For example, the instructions below create instances with publically accessible
IP addresses and AWS-managed EC2 security keys. This is likely sufficient security
for users attempting to run the simulator with published data.

Here are instructions for two possible scenarios for running CAMPAREE on AWS.

Single Instance in Serial Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By checking out a single, high-memory machine, users can run CAMPAREE on AWS in
serial mode. Note, the instructions listed here for checking out an AWS instance
rely mostly on the default settings. Users with managed AWS accounts may need
to alter their accounts to allow them to checkout instances, and/or adapt these
instructions to work within their accounts' restrictions.

As RAM tends to be the bottleneck for most CAMPAREE processes, rather than the
number of CPU cores, we recommend users select a `Memory Optimized <https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/>`_
machine, like the r4.2xlarge (8 vCPUs; 61 GiB RAM).

1. Go to the `EC2 management console <https://aws.amazon.com/console/>`_ to begin
   launching an AWS instance. Note, the current AWS region for your account is
   indicated at the top of the Management Console, to the left of the 'Support'
   menu. Any instances you create will launch in this region, so select a region
   that contains both the instance type, and the EC2 security key you wish to use.

2. Use the following configuration for the AWS instance:

    AMI: 'Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS (HVM), SSD Volume Type'
        AMIs will vary by AWS region. Enter the above name in the AMI search bar
        to find the AMI specific to your region. Here are specific AMIs for the
        four AWS regions in the US.

        ========== ==========
        AWS Region    AMI
        ========== ==========
        us-east-1  ami-07ebfd5b3428b6f4d (64-bit x86)
        us-east-2  ami-07c1207a9d40bc3bd (64-bit x86)
        us-west-1  ami-0f56279347d2fa43e (64-bit x86)
        us-west-2  ami-003634241a8fcdec0 (64-bit x86)
        ========== ==========

    Configure Instance Details (defaults except for the following):
        - Network: Depends on user's account.
        - Subnet: Depends on user's account.
        - Auto-assign Public IP: Enable

    Add Storage:
        Default volume:
            Size: *Still working out recommendations based on input size*

    [Optional] Add Tags:
        Key: 'Name', Value: 'CAMPAREE'

    Configure Security Group:
        Depends on user's account.

    Select EC2 Security Key pair (after clicking 'Launch Instance'):
        Choose an existing key pair (will only display options from the same
        regions as the subnet selected above).

2. Confirm instance details, launch, and wait for the instance to enter running state.

3. Login to instance with ssh (requires the \*.pem file associated with the EC2
   security key selected above).

4. Install CAMPAREE pre-requisites::

    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -y upgrade
    sudo apt-get -y install openjdk-8-jre python3-venv python3-pip

5. Follow CAMPAREE installation instructions :ref:`above <installing-general>`.

6. Prepare CAMPAREE config file, making sure to set ``scheduler_mode:`` to 'serial'.

7. CAMPAREE is now ready to run in **serial** mode.

AWS ParallelCluster in SGE Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `AWS ParallelCluster <https://aws.amazon.com/hpc/parallelcluster/>`_ program
provides a command line utility to create and manage a cluster environment entirely
on AWS. ParallelCluster will automatically add and remove compute nodes as they
are needed, and supports several job managers (including SGE). Currently, the
account used to launch the ParallelCluster must have full admin privileges (the
default for most unmanaged AWS accounts).

Again, we recommend using `Memory Optimized <https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/>`_
machines, like the r4.2xlarge, for the compute nodes on the ParallelCluster. For
the master node, a machine with lower specs, like the m5.large (2 vCPUs; 8 GiB
RAM), should be adequate.

Note, these instructions were last tested using ParallelCluster version 2.6.1.

1. Install AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) version 2 following `these instructions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html>`_.

2. Configure AWS CLI following `these instructions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html#cli-quick-configuration>`_, entering a region matching the desired AWS key pair.

3. Install AWS ParallelCluster following to `these instructions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/parallelcluster/latest/ug/install.html>`_.

4. Configure ParallelCluster by running the ``pcluster configure`` command and entering the following options

    - AWS Region ID: <enter region matching desired EC2 key pair>
    - EC2 Key Pair Name: <select desired EC2 key pair>
    - Scheduler: 'sge'
    - Operating System: 'ubuntu1804' (required for pre-install script used below)
    - Minimum cluster size (instances): '1'
    - Maximum cluster size (instances): '10' (By default, extra instances are only added when a job waits in the queue for 10 minutes)
    - Master instance type: m5.large
    - Compute instance type: r4.2xlarge
    - Automate VPC creation? y
    - Network Configuration: Master in a public subnet and compute fleet in a private subnet

5. Edit ParallelCluster config to add a custom startup script and request additional memory.

    Start by opening the ParallelCluster config file (generally located at
    ``~/.parallelcluster/config``) with a text editor.

    - Custom startup script:
        ParallelCluster supports post-install scripts that run on each of the
        nodes after they've been added to the cluster. This script will install
        all of CAMPAREE's prerequisites. Append the following line to the end of
        the ``[cluster default]`` section of the config file::

            post_install = s3://itmat.data-simulators/parallelcluster_camparee_prereqs_postinstall_Ubuntu1804.sh

    - Additional disk space:
        ParallelCluster defaults to 20 GiB of hard disk space. CAMPAREE requires
        additional space to store resource files, input FASTQ files, intermediate
        files (including parental genomes), and the final output. To increase the
        amount of shared hard disk space when creating a parallel cluster, make
        the following additions to the config file. First, append the following
        line to the end of the ``[cluster default]`` section of the config file::

            ebs_settings = default

        Second, append the following lines to the end of the config file, separated
        from the preceding section by a blank lane::

            [ebs default]
            volume_size = *Still working out recommendations based on input size*

6. Launch the ParallelCluster::

    pcluster create camparee-cluster

7. Once the cluster is full initialized, connect to the master node::

    pcluster ssh camparee-cluster -i /path/to/AWS_key_file.pem

8. Install CAMPAREE on the cluster using the instructions listed :ref:`above <installing-general>`. Note, the prerequisites were already handled by the post-install script.

9. Prepare CAMPAREE config file, making sure to set ``scheduler_mode:`` to 'sge'.

10. CAMPAREE is now ready to run in **sge** mode.

When you have finished running CAMPAREE and have transferred all data off of the
cluster, you can shut down and delete the cluster with the following command::

    pcluster delete camparee-cluster

Note, all data on the ParallelCluster will be lost after this command completes.
